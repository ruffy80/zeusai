# 🦄 Live Baseline — Last-Known-Good

**Pinned SHA:** `9b8431a9bd8325acfbead96bfe448881cd5db500`
**Pinned date:** `2026-05-04 16:05 UTC`
**Pinned by:** automation lock-in commit on 2026-05-04 (see PR
"observe-automated-activities") — advances baseline forward over the
restoration work merged 2026-05-04 13:54–16:05 UTC.

**Previous baseline:** `b72ff9b551b93ce8074835062fd9572110ed1529` (2026-05-02 20:23 UTC)

## Why this is pinned

This is the last commit on `main` that was simultaneously confirmed live by:

| Source | Run | Time UTC | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| `🚀 Unicorn Stable Deploy` (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) | last on `9b8431a` | 2026-05-04 16:05 | ✅ success |
| Restoration sequence merged into `main` | `9a72cfd5` → `9b8431a9` | 2026-05-04 14:03–16:05 | ✅ success |

This pin captures the state immediately after the bulk restoration of
features rolled back by PR #492 (commit `9a72cfd5`) plus the subsequent
fixes that brought all six deploy attempts that day green:
auth-guardian loop neutralized (`9970f465`), `/api/catalog/master` routing
fixed (`3626fd21`), site-routed APIs restored (`8a3025e9`/`f49404dc`),
`/api/services` SSE announcer (`b51a787a`), and `/api/services` hydrated
from `buildMasterCatalog` (`9b8431a9`).

Pinning here means **no automation can ever revert `main` below this
state again** — including the `[AutoInnovation]` auto-merge bot, any
live-sync script (already neutralized), or any external runner using a
PAT.

## No-downgrade contract

`.github/baselines/live.sha` contains the SHA above as a single line. It is
read by:

1. `.github/workflows/no-downgrade-guard.yml` — runs on every push to `main`.
   Refuses any HEAD that is **not** a strict descendant of the pinned SHA.
2. The pre-flight step in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — refuses to
   ssh-rsync to Hetzner unless HEAD is a descendant of the pinned SHA.
3. The neutralized `scripts/auto-sync-push.sh` and the legacy live-sync
   launchers — the old push-to-git path still exits immediately, while the
   launcher names now resolve to the forward-only daemon in
   `UNICORN_FINAL/scripts/live-sync-forward.js`. The live filesystem on
   Hetzner can no longer push a stale snapshot back into git the way it did
   with commit `0dacd1c` (`live-sync: 2026-05-03 00:47:25` → -1216 lines).
4. The **AutoInnovation guard** in `no-downgrade-guard.yml` and the
   `deploy.yml` pre-flight: any commit whose subject begins with
   `[AutoInnovation]` between baseline and HEAD must carry the
   `[innovation-approved]` trailer in its body **or** be explicitly
   allowlisted in `.github/baselines/innovation-approved-shas.txt`
   (one SHA per line, optional trailing comment).
   Otherwise CI fails red and the deploy refuses to ssh-rsync.
   This stops the auto-innovation bot (which currently opens + auto-merges
   PRs from `auto-innovation/**` branches) from ever pushing unreviewed code
   to live, even if it merges to `main` via an external PAT.

## How to advance the baseline (the only allowed direction)

After a new green deploy + green global probe at the same SHA:

```bash
git rev-parse HEAD > .github/baselines/live.sha
git add .github/baselines/live.sha LIVE_BASELINE.md
git commit -m "baseline(live): advance to <sha> [upgrade-approved]

verified by: deploy.yml run #<N>, global-health.yml run #<M>"
```

The `[upgrade-approved]` trailer is what unlocks the deletion guard for
the bumping commit itself, so the baseline file can be updated without
tripping the no-downgrade workflow.

### Automated advancement

`.github/workflows/auto-baseline-advance.yml` performs the bump
automatically once both gates are simultaneously green at the same SHA:

1. `🚀 Unicorn Stable Deploy` succeeded at SHA `X`.
2. `🌍 Global Availability Probe` succeeded at the same SHA `X`.
3. `X` is a strict descendant of the currently pinned baseline.

When all three hold, the workflow rewrites `.github/baselines/live.sha`,
appends a row to the auto-advance log below, and commits with the
`[upgrade-approved]` trailer so `no-downgrade-guard.yml` accepts the
bumping commit. Re-runs at the same SHA are idempotent. The workflow
also runs on a 1-hour `cron` schedule and is manually dispatchable with
an optional `force_sha` input for emergency forward rolls.

## Emergency runtime rollback — `SITE_LEGACY_BASELINE_MODE=1`

Independent of the git-baseline pin above, the site worker
(`UNICORN_FINAL/src/index.js`) honors a single env knob that collapses
every post-`89a8b7f3` (2026-05-04 17:21 UTC) feature back to the exact
`89a8b7f3` baseline behavior, **without any code revert**:

```bash
SITE_LEGACY_BASELINE_MODE=1 pm2 restart unicorn-site --update-env
```

When set, the `legacyBaselineModeGuard` IIFE at the top of
`src/index.js` propagates these defaults (operator-set values are never
overwritten):

| Disabled | Restores |
|---|---|
| `SITE_COMPRESSION_DISABLED=1` | No gzip/brotli at the dispatcher level. |
| `SITE_ASSET_MEMCACHE_DISABLED=1` | `/assets/app.js` + `/assets/aeon.js` re-read from disk per request (pre-PR #515 behavior). |
| `SITE_PREDICTIVE_PREFETCH_DISABLED=1` | No HTTP 103 Early Hints, no `Link: rel=prefetch` extension. |
| `SITE_SPECULATION_RULES_DISABLED=1` | No `<script type="speculationrules">` in SSR `<head>`. |
| `SITE_RUM_BEACONS_DISABLED=1` | No Web Vitals collector script; `/internal/rum*` endpoints respond 204 / 503. |
| `PREFETCH_PERSIST_DISABLED=1` | No `data/perf/prefetch-graph.jsonl` read or write. |

This is the canonical answer to "give me the site exactly as it was 4.5
hours ago, with everything I added since untouched but inactive". The
PR #515 / PR #516 / prerender-gate code paths remain in the binary; the
guard only disables their runtime side effects. Each individual disable
knob can also be flipped on its own for surgical rollbacks.

Verified by `UNICORN_FINAL/test/legacy-baseline-mode.test.js`.
